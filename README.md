# dislocker

##INTRODUCTION AND EXPLANATIONS

This software has been designed to read BitLocker encrypted partitions under a Linux system. The driver used to only read volumes encrypted under a Windows 7 system but is now Windows Vista capable and has the write functionality.

The driver can run into two different modes : with or without FUSE. This mode is decided at compilation time within the Makefile.

With FUSE, you have to give the program a mount point. Once keys are decrypted, a file named `dislocker-file' appears into this provided mount point. This file is a virtual NTFS partition, so you can mount it as any NTFS partition and then read from it or write to it.

Without FUSE, you have to give a file name where the BitLocker encrypted partition will be decrypted. This may take a long time, depending on the size of the encrypted partition. But afterward, once the partition is decrypted, the access to the NTFS partition will be faster. Another thing to think about is the size on your disk this method need (same size as the volume you're trying to decrypt). Nethertheless, once the partition is decrypted, you can mount your file as any NTFS partition.


##INSTALLATION AND REQUIREMENTS

See INSTALL.txt for things dealing with the install process.

Once installed, see man dislocker(1) for details on how to use it.


##BUGS

A precise test table is present into the INSTALL.txt file.

##NOTE

In many directories included into the sources, there's a Makefile with rules to build a standalone binary. To build these standalone binaries, cd to the directory and type `make`, thus creating a binary which you can use to do some process separately.

###Binary capable directories:

- accesses/bek/: read a .bek file and display information about it;
- accesses/rp/: calculate the intermediate key for a given recovery password;
- encryption/: test encryption/decryption on a test case;
- metadata/: read a BitLocker volume and display information about its metadata;
- outputs/fuse/: FUSE's hello world example.
